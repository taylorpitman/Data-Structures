# 📂 Data Structures Cheat Sheet 🚀

### 📢 What's This?
This is my personal stash of **data structures** with **commented code** explaining:  
- What each method does ✍️  
- The **time complexity** ⏳ so I don’t forget  
- (Maybe) some **popular interview questions** related to each one 🤓  

Basically, this is my **cheat sheet** for when I don’t want to Google "LinkedList time complexity" for the millionth time.

### 📑 What's Inside?
Each folder = one data structure. Inside, you’ll find:
📂 LinkedList 
├── LinkedList.java # Code with comments 
├── README.md # Short notes (if I feel like writing them) 
├── Interview_Questions.md # (Optional) Common questions

🔹 **Everything is super simple & straight to the point.**  
🔹 No crazy deep dives—just enough to remember how things work.
